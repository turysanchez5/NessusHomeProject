# NessusHomeProject

Vulnerability mangement project where Installed and configured Nessus Essentials in order to run vulnerability scans against a Windows 10 Hosts old outdated Firefox on VM. 

Made adjustments to VM firewall settings in order to make it vulnerable and get better results by searching wf.msc. 

Configured VMs Remote Registry by searching services.mse which allowed me to run a credential scan and return better results.
